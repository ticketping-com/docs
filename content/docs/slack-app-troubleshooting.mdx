description: Common issues when installing or using the Ticketping Slack app
---

Most teams install the Ticketping Slack app without issues.  
If something doesn’t work as expected, here are the most common fixes:

---

## I don’t see the **Add to Slack** button
- Make sure you are logged into the [Ticketping Dashboard](https://ticketping.com/dashboard).
- Only Slack workspace admins can authorize new apps.  
  Ask an admin in your team to complete the installation.
- You might already have installed it.
- Start the Ticketping Slack App onboarding again through [this link](https://ticketping.com/dashboard/onboard-slack)

## Messages aren’t coming through to Slack
- Confirm that the chat widget has been set up with the correct **teamSlug** from your dashboard.  
- Check if Ticketping bot is present in your Slack channel — if not, reconfigure it via [this link](https://ticketping.com/dashboard/onboard-slack)
