Ticketping as a customer support product really shines when you use it with Slack. Otherwise, it's similar to other support products out there like Intercom, Zendesk, etc.

## Steps

1. Visit the Ticketping dashboard.  
2. Click **Add to Slack**.  
3. Approve the permissions.  
4. Done âœ…

You're all set to receive new ticket notifs in your Slack channel. 

> _Note: You only need to do this once per Slack workspace._

## How to reply to a ticket in Slack

Just tag `@Ticketping` slack bot and reply in the thread. Your response will be sent to the customer and also sync with Ticketping admin dashboard.

ðŸ‘‰ **Important:** Always reply in the Slack **thread** (not as a new message in the channel) â€” that way your support slack channel stays tidy and your teammates donâ€™t get spammed.  


### New tickets

`@Ticketping` will post a fresh message in the channel for every new ticket.  

### Replies

Always reply inside that messageâ€™s **thread**. The bot will forward your reply to the customer and post customer replies in the same thread.  

### Private notes

Want to chat just with your Slack team? Leave a reply **without tagging `@Ticketping`** â€” those stay internal.
