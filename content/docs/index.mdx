description: Get started with Ticketping - AI Customer Support in Slack
---

Welcome to Ticketping Docs ðŸ‘‹

Ticketping lets your team run customer support directly from Slack.  
There are two things you need to do before you can start:

1. **Install the Slack App** â†’ connect Ticketping to your workspace.  
2. **Install the Chat Widget** â†’ add our widget to your product so customers can reach you.

The Slack app install is quick (any team admin can do it).  
The Chat Widget requires a developer to add a small code snippet to your site or app.

Let's get started!
